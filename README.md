# Interactive Dock
A simple, animated, interactive dock for rainmeter.  
![alt text](https://github.com/callmeEthan/InteractiveDock/raw/master/preview.gif)  
This is pretty much just a dock, the animation will cost a percentage of performance depending on your hardware. While I have optimized it to do this as little as possible (only animate when interact with), please only use it when you have performance to spare.  

## Feature
* When the skin is first loaded, it will play a loading animation (once) to welcome you.  
* Auto hide animation to keep your desktop clean (which can be toggle off), and appear when hover mouse over the skin.
* Smooth animation and only when interacted, otherwise stay as static skin (minimal impact on performance). Animation relies on lua script for cpu efficiency.
* Can show as horizontal dock or vertical dock, pop in from left or right, configurable in the setting file.

## Installation
Require rainmeter 4+ and windows 10.  
Download rainmeter at https://www.rainmeter.net/.  
Download and install [skin file](https://github.com/callmeEthan/InteractiveDock/raw/master/interactive_dock_for_rainmeter.rmskin)

## Usage
* Right click anywhere and choose toggle edit to switch to edit mode
* Then you can drag and drop an image or file onto a specific icon in the skin directly. (if file is an image supported by rainmeter, it will be automatically used as icon, or set as directory if it's any other type of file)
* Select Add icon to show more icon.
* Hover over an icon, right click and select Remove icon to remove selected from list.
  
You could edit list manually by edit Resources\Applist.inc
